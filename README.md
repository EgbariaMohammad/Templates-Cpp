# Templates-Cpp

This Repo contains some of the Tempaltes I worked on throughout my Bachelor's Journey.
Some where implemented as part of HomeWorks, some where implemented as part of Side Projects and some where implemented for fun :)
In the repo you will find the following Tempaltes:
 - SortedList.h
 - Queue.h
 - AVLTree.h
 - UnionFind.h
 - HashTable.h

NOTE: the templates don't use STL but rather Implement everything from scratch, thus, you may not have all the features you'd usually have in an STL Container
